 * Requires a process or data mapping exercise's outputs

**Threat Identification (30 minutes per process):** 

 * Give participants a "cheat sheet" of threats.
  * Explain the types of threats.
    * **Confidentiality**: If unauthorized individuals find out an asset/process exists.
    * **Control**: If an asset/process can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    * **Integrity**: If an asset/process is changed without permission.
    * **Availability**: If an asset/process becomes unavailable.
    * **Consistency**: If an asset/process becomes unreliable. (Some use **Identity** instead or in addition to Consistency, if an asset/process can be spoofed to appear as owning/coming from someone else.)
  	* **Auditability**: If you cannot verify that an asset/process is secure.
   * Identify a "interaction line" from the process map to start with.
  * Generate a list of threats that would cause that interaction to fail.
  * Mark the back of the post-it with the interaction name or number.
  * Write the threat and their impact on post-its and arrange them in an orderly way.
  * If multiple risks cause the same consequence create a new post-it near the new risk.
  * Continue doing this for all the interactions in the critical process'.
  * Discuss and rearrange threats as groupings emerge.
  * Label threat clusters that appear.
  
  * **NOTES:**
    * If any of the impacts identified in the pre-mortum or other process-mapping exercises are not covered ask participants where they would go.
    * Take photos of the threats once you have finished enumerating them.
    * Write risks on one set of post-its and impacts on another color of post-its to make it easy to keep track.
	* Look at the ["CVSS v3 Base Metrics"](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0) for an example of the severity of different threats.

**Impact Identification (30 minutes per process):** This exercise has the trainee lead the participants on a brainstorming of hypothetical consequences (impacts) when the threats identified earlier occur.

  * Give participants a pen and three sticky note pads.
  * Explain the topic and the categories. [^GPR_8_impacts]
    * Staff/People - (which includes families, friends, and beneficiaries): temporary or permanent
physical injury, temporary or longer-term psychological damage, death, legal costs, cost of medical treatment, loss of morale or trust in management.
    * Organization - loss of or damage to assets, operational inefficiency, loss of program quality or outright suspension; loss of reputation; loss of funding.
    * Program - reduced program quality, temporary suspension of the program, forced termination of the program.
  * Instruct each person to generate DIRECT impacts based upon the exiting threat clustering from **Threat Identification.**
  * Include only one impact per sticky note.
  * Have one participant quickly describe then place an impact on the board writing along side it the threat that causes it.
  * Invite others to place similar/the same impacts in proximity and quickly describe how it can occurs.
  * Repeat the process until all impacts are included.
  * Have participants add stickies for any secondary/cascading impacts
  * Discuss and rearrange impacts as groupings emerge.
  * Label impact clusters that appear.
  
  * **NOTES:**
    * Tell participants to write multiple impacts per color.
	* Look for opportunities to create sub-groups.
	* Limit the time frame for discussion.
    * Take photos of the impact clusters once you have finished enumerating them.

**Adversary Exploration (Likelyhood):** 

  * Explain the topic and the categories. [^GPR_8_Likelihood]
    * "History – a past incidence or pattern of attacks on similar organizations."
    * "Intent – specific threats, a demonstrated intention or mindset to attack."
    * "Capability – the wherewithal to carry out an attack."
  * Brainstorm adversaries who have demonstrated likelihood to impact their work or one of the process'.
  * Pick an adversary and write their name on the board.
  * Write specific instances of adversary history, intent, and capacity announced by the participants.
  * Repeat the process until all adversaries are completed.
  
  * **NOTES:**
	* Limit the time frame for discussion.
    * Take photos of the adversary lists.

**Impact Ranking:** The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the host organization in classifying the severity of the possible impacts from the threats they have just explored. 

  * Create a post it for each impact.
  * Place two points on the wall. On one side are "Inconvenient" impacts that disrupt the organization in a very small way. On the other side are "critical" impacts that may pose life-safety risks to employees, partners, or the general public.
  * The low end of the scale may include  a fire alarm may cause the staff to lose a half an hour of work time, but does not impact any short or long-term activities.
  * The high end of the scale would include events such as a fire that destroys the organizations headquarters and endangers staffs lives or legal issues that cause termination of the program.
  * Place each item along the severity line from least to most severe impact.
  * Give each item its own place on the scale. No two items can be the same severity.

  * **NOTES:**
	* Listen carefully to every point of deliberation. 
    * As risks are placed on the wall, the trainee can use other already ranked risks to help participants identify the right place. "Is a robbery more or less likely than a fire?"
    * Take photos of the impact scale once you have finished it.
