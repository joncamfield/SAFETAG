The questions below are roughly divided into categories for management, program staff, and technical staff.  The questions for technical staff may be best asked of the manager or another point of contact.  Within that section, there are specific questions that often only actual IT staff are likely to be able to answer.  An auditor may find value in re-asking the same questions to multiple staff members.  Specifically, however, the "Baseline Threat Identification Questions" should be asked of whoever the auditor feels most able or willing to answer them.

In all cases, the HCD Toolkit recommends that you "warm up the participant with questions they are comfortable with." [^HCD_toolkit] -- balance this against not asking questions which you should already know from basic organizational research, followed with informative questions which "prompt bigger, even aspirational, thinking that they may not be accustomed to on a daily basis." [^HCD_toolkit]
