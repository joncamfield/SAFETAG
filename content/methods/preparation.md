title: Preparation
summary: >
  This component consists of trip preparation activities that are needed to
  ensure the technical and facilitated components of the audit are able to be
  conducted effectively and within the on-site time-frame.
purpose: >
  A SAFETAG audit has a short time frame. Preparation is vital to ensure that
  time on the ground is not spent negotiating over the audit scope, updating the
  auditors systems, searching for missing hardware, or refreshing oneself with
  the SAFETAG framework. To that end negotiations with the host organization
  help reveal if the organization has the capacity to undertake the audit and
  respond to its findings.
guiding_questions: >

  * Does the organization have existing digital security practices or has it
  attempted to implement them in the past?

  * What agreements will govern the audit?

  * What will be the procedure for incident handling in the event that the
  auditor causes or uncovers an incident during the course of the assessment?

  * What are the legal, physical, or social risks for the auditor & organization
  associated with conducting the audit or having audit results leak?
  [^PETS_legal_considerations]

  * Does the security situation of the location or organization require
  additional planning? Are your software tools up to date and working as
  expected?
approaches: >

  * **Create an Assessment Plan:** Have a "scoping" meeting that outlines the
  level of access that an auditor will have, what is off limits, and the process
  for modifying the scope of the audit when new information arises.
  [^PETS_legal_considerations]^,^[^PETS_separate_permissions]

  * **Negotiate a Confidentiality Agreement:** Negotiate an agreement with the
  organization that outlines how an auditor will protect the privacy of the
  organization and the outcomes of the audit.

  * **Establish an Emergency Contact:** Establish a procedure for incident
  handling and an emergency contact in the event that the auditor causes or
  uncovers an incident during the course of the assessment.
  [^NIST_SP_800-115-Section_7.1]^,^[^PETS_emergency_contact]

  * **Conduct Research** (See [Context Research](#context-research)) to identify
  potential adversaries and their capabilities, and explore the latest cyber
  security and topical trends, to assess risk for the auditing process itself.

  * **Prepare for Travel:** Check travel logistical needs -- visa, letter of
  invitation, travel tickets and hotel reservations. Note that some visas can
  take significant effort and may require the auditor to be without a passport
  while they are being processed.

  * **Prepare Systems:** Update and test your systems, A/V and audit
  tools[^latest_version_of_tools], prepare storage devices and systems to
  reflect the required operational security, and ensure you have power supply
  adapters, cables and relevant adapters, usb drives, external wireless cards
  and any other equipment needed for testing.

output: |2
   * An agreement with the organisation to receive the audit including scope, timeframe, confidentiality clauses, operational security measures or minimums, and points of contact.
   * Any Visas or paperwork needed, plus travel arragements (tickets, hotels) for auditor travel.
   * A travel kit. [^travel_kit_appendix]^,^[^NIST_SP_800-115-travel_prep]
   * Systems updated and ready for testing.
   * A custom password dictionary [^password_dictionary_resources] (if password cracking activities expected).
   * Risks to host and auditor conducting a SAFETAG audit.
   * Modifications to the audit plan as necessary.
