Due to the wide variety of needs found during SAFETAG audits, the framework relies on the wealth of existing training curricula and digital security guides, listed below.

Of specific use are the following training guides from Level-Up. Review the [Level-Up Curricula Guide](https://level-up.cc/before-an-event/using-levelup-trainers-curriculum/) prior to using these activities:

* [Malware Fundamentals and Social Engineering](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/malware-protection/using-antivirus-tools/input/malware-101/)
* [Secure Passwords](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/creating-and-managing-strong-passwords/)
