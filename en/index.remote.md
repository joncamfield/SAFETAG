## SAFETAG Playlist: Remote Assessment

The SAFETAG framework can also be used in situations where the auditor cannot travel to the organization at all, or cannot travel to remote or multiple office locations.

Many of the activities included in the framework (for example for the reconnaissance and follow-up stages) do not require the auditor to be on site, while others are more difficult to perform remotely, especially if access to physical devices is needed.

This playlist has been created to highlight the possibilities of carrying out a full SAFETAG audit from remote, with customized activities for remote operational security assessment, office mapping, local
scanning, device assessment, and group facilitation.

More information on the single modules that address remote assessment methods can be found in [this article](https://safetag.org/2017/08/31/Remote_Audits.html).

Due to the wide variety of needs found during SAFETAG audits, the framework relies on the wealth of existing training curricula and digital security guides, listed below.

Of specific use are the following training guides from Level-Up. Review the [Level-Up Curricula Guide](https://level-up.cc/before-an-event/using-levelup-trainers-curriculum/e) prior to using these activities:

* [Malware Fundamentals and Social Engineering](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/malware-protection/using-antivirus-tools/input/malware-101/)
