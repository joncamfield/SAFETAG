You should consider a web application compromise serious and coordinate an incident response if any of the following is happening:

- Unusual accounts are created in server and CMS
- Access logs from outside regions beyond the organizations location
- Malicious php scripts (webshells) are present on the server
- Defaced web pages and are sometimes password protected
