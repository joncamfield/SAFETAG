Performing web vulnerability assessment can be done in different ways, using different tools and having different results. Choosing any of these steps or guides must not confuse an auditor, but instead, provide a broader scope which should help them finding vulnerabilities as many as they can.

These vulnerabilities can range from:
- Web Server/OS level vulnerabilities
- Access control vulnerabilities
- Application-specific vulnerabilities
- Misconfiguration
- SQL Injection
- Cross-site Scripting
- Directory Traversal
- Failure to restrict URL Access
- Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
- LDAP Injections
- Malicious Codes
- Leaked information

Before pursuing any of these more active scans, review outputs from passive reconnsaisance, DNS history and current information, and (if relevant) CMS version checking. This guide covers a small subset of web vulnerability scanning tools, a more comprehensive list is available at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools which may provide approaches better suited to specific situations.

OpenVAS, covered in the vulnerablity scanning activity, also includes Wapiti, which can help to detect many of the above common vulnerablitites.
