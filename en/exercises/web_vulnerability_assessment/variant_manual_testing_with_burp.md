**Introduction**

According to Burp's official [documentation](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1783101-how-to-use-burp-suite), "Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. It is **not a point-and-click** tool, but is designed to be used by hands-on testers to support the testing process. With a little bit of effort, anyone can start using the core features of Burp to test the security of their applications. Some of Burp's more advanced features will take further learning and experience to master."  To know more about BurpSuite's other tools and features, visit BurpSuite's [Tools](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burptools) and it's [functions](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_functions) pages.

**Requirements**

Note: If you are using Kali Linux, you already have Burpsuite pre-installed. Otherwise if you do not have a Linux box, refer to the following requirements below:

- Windows/MAC OSX (Kali Linux Preferred)
- [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
- Browser ([Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/))
- [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)

All of this investment is hugely worth it - Burp's user-driven workflow is by the far the most effective way to perform web security testing, and will take you way beyond the capabilities of any conventional point-and-click scanner. Burp is intuitive and user-friendly, and the best way to start learning is by doing. These steps will get you started with running Burp and using its basic features. You can then read on deeper into the documentation to become more proficient in using this supremely powerful tool.

Burp Suite contains various tools for performing different testing tasks. The tools operate effectively together, and you can pass interesting requests between tools as your work progresses, to carry out different actions.

Burp's [Getting Started Documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted) is quite detailed and useful, and strongly recommends launching Burp from the command line for better control. In specific, it recommends assigning the amount of memory you wish to dedicate to burp:

**Launching Burpsuite**

With Java installed, on some platforms you may be able to run Burp directly by double-clicking the Burp JAR file. However, it is preferable to launch Burp from the command line, as this gives you more control over its execution, in particular the amount of memory that your computer assigns to Burp. To do this, in your command prompt type a command like:

```
java -jar -Xmx1024m /path/to/burp.jar
```

where 1024 is the amount of memory (in Mb) that you want to assign to Burp, and /path/to/burp.jar is the location of the Burp JAR file on your computer.

The [troubleshooting help](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_troubleshooting.html) can help if Burp doesn't appear shortly.

**Setting up your environment**

- Verifying Scope/Target:
      - Always check that you have the right URL/Domain before starting. Last thing we wanted to happen is to scan a different target that is out of our scope!

- Setting up your browser

   - For Firefox:
     - Paste ```about:preferences#advanced``` this in your URL, and click ```Settings``` left of **Connection**
     - Click ```Manual proxy configuration``` and enter ```localhost``` under **HTTP Proxy**, with Port set to: ```8080```
     - Check ```Use this proxy server for all protocols```

   - For Chrome:
     - Paste ```chrome://settings/system``` then click **Open proxy Settings**
     - This will open the **Network Setting* windows in Kali. Click **Network proxy** and set *Method* to ```Manual```
      - Set **HTTP Proxy** to ```127.0.0.1``` with **Port** valued at ```8080```
      - Configure the rest of settings with following values above (HTTPS, FTP Proxies, and Socks Host)

- Setting up Socks Proxy (Optional)
   - In some cases, you will be required to scan from an approved testing environment or a specific network/IP range. In this case, you have to configure Socks Proxy for your assessment.
   - Verify your IP. Take note of your current IP address. ([WhatismyIP.com](http://whatismyip.com/))
   - To setup your Socks Proxy, we can do this by connecting via SSH to our server:
     - ```ssh –D 9292 –l username@server_name/ip```
   - Once authenticated, configure Burpsuite to route it's traffic to our outbound SSH tunnel.
     - From **Options** Tab, click **Connections** sub-tab and scroll down to ```Socks Proxy```
     - In **Socks Proxy host**, type ```localhost```. and under **Socks Proxy port**, type ```9292```
     - Then check **Use SOCKS proxy** button
   - You can again [check](http://whatismyip.com/) your IP address to verify if your configuration is correct.

**Testing Burpsuite Configuration**

*NOTE: Scanning web applications without the owner's permission is potentially illegal. It is important that you test Burpsuite on your own web applications, or on a controlled environment. There are some publicly available websites that are insecure by default to be used for testing and learning purposes. Among these were:*

   - [bWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.co) - Buggy Web Application
   - [HackThis](https://www.hackthis.co.uk) - Hacker's Playground
   - [HackThisSite](http://www.hackthissite.org/) - Community Driven hacking exercises
   - [HackMe](https://hack.me/s/) - Community based, collaborative hacking exercises and vulnerable web apps
   - [CrackMeBank](http://crackme.cenzic.com/kelev/view/home.php)

*(You can use these sites to get familiar with Burpsuite, and performing the following excerices in this guide.)*

**Intercepting Request**

   - To start intercepting traffic to and from your target domain/URL, in your configured browser, enter the the target domain, and hit enter.
   - On your Burpsuite instance, under **Proxy** Tab, and sub-tab **Intercept**, make sure that the ```Intercept``` button is on.
   - If it captures the request from your Firefox browser, it means that your configuration is correct.
   - Click ```Forward``` and the request will be forwarded to the server/target and the next sub-tab **HTTP History** will now start to generate some contents, each time you open a link, or a page within the target domain.

**Adding Target/Scope**
   - Adding your target into scope is important so you won't miss, or even scan URLs that are not included in your list of targets.
   - To add the target to your scope, right-click the domain/website, then select **Add to Scope**
   - Burp will now tell you if you want ot stop sending out-of-scope items in your **HTTP history** tab and other Burp Tools - click **Yes**.
   - This will now appear in your **Target** tab, and under **Scope** sub-tab.
   - To add subdomains into your scope, you can use regex:
   ```.*\.test\.com$```

**Managing Burp Projects**
   - Managing burpsuites project will depend on the version you are using. Some features may not be available for free version of burp, but are only available for Pro Version. See burp's documentation for managing projects [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects)
   - Selecting project type:
      - Temporary project - Quick tasks, no need to save data
      - New project on Disk - Creates new project and stores it on disk on a ["Burp project file"](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects#projectfiles)
      - Open existing project - Opens recent existing project from a ["Burp project file"](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects#projectfiles). Scanners & spiders are paused.
   
   - Selecting Configuration
      - Burp Defaults - BurpSuite's default options
      - Use options Saved within project - Only available when reopening an existing project. It uses the options saved from the previous project
      - Load from a configuration file - Opens a project using the options contained on a [Burp Configuration File](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects#configfiles)

**NOTE:** According to BurpSuite documentation, *"If you open an existing project that was created by a different installation of Burp, then Burp will prompt you to decide whether to take full ownership of the project.*

*This decision is needed because Burp stores within the project file an identifier that is used to retrieve any ongoing Burp Collaborator interactions that are associated with the project. If two instances of Burp share the same identifier in ongoing work, then some Collaborator-based issues may be missed or incorrectly reported. You should only take full ownership of a project from a different Burp installation if no other instance of Burp is working on that project."*

Since that Burpsuite is an advance tool for testing web applications, This guide will cover most of the basic testing activities for Burpsuite. To learn more of the advance features, it is important that you have a licensed version.

**Basic BurpSuite Testing Excercises:**

Attacking web application using simple payload set (Bruteforce attack):
   - Verify that your Burp is working
      - You must first try to test if your Burp and browser are both configured
   
   - Login page of target application
      - Now try visiting any login page of your target web application (you can use any test site mentioned above)
   
   - "Intercept On" - Make sure that you have your burpsuite's intercept function set to "ON".
      - Before you click "ENTER" to submit your sample credentials, you can intercept web traffic request from your browser to the server under **Proxy** > **Intercept** tab, then "Intercept" button is set to "ON".
      
   - Review contents of the requests under **Proxy** > **Intercept** > **Raw**
      - On the **Raw** tab, Once you see the "POST /login.php" request of your browser to the web application server, select ALL and right-click on the selected/highlighted texts and select **Send to Intruder** 
   
   - Now under **Intruder** > **number tab** > **Target** uncheck "Use HTTPs".
   - Now click under **Intruder** > **number tab** > **Position** to view all replaceble variables.
   - Try looking for ```email``` and ```pass```,  
      - You can either change your variable for ```email``` and ```pass``` for earch or just include ONE variable. For this exercise, we will use the ```pass``` variable.
   - Now under **Intruder** > **Payloads**
      - You can define here the number of payload sets depdening on  your attack type (for our case, since we only have 1, let's use 1)
   - Now below the options ```Payload Sets```, you can see ```Payload Options``` where you can ```add```, ```Paste```, ```add from list``` strings that you can use as your payload.
   - After typing your list of strings or passwords, let's go to **Positions** tab, and on the right side of ```Payload Options```  click **Start Attack**
   - After clicking "Start Attack" it will open a window of results usually your HTTP responses codes.
   
Take note of these errors to see how the target web application respond when given certain types of strings.
