Thoroughly research technical attack history for the country/region, with a focus on identifying attacks which may focus on the work of the organization. Auditors are advised to track both capability (known attacks and tools) and intent (attempts to aquire tools, changes in policies, public statements). For auditors who intend to share their research efforts, it is incredibly useful to include key quotes and data directly into relevant sections of this document, providing a reference or link back to the original report. This allows future reviewers to more immediately understand your assessment, what it has included and not, and incorporate new material.

It is useful to categorize the research into categories:

* **Surveillance** (Surveillance Technology, Encryption Regulation, Identity Tracking, Requests for User Information)
* **Targeted Attacks** (Targeting Ability, Technical Sophistication)
* **Censorship and Connectivity** (Network Ownership, Shutdowns, Targeted Censorship, Blocking apps, Blocking Circumvention)
* **Seizure and Theft** (Device Confiscation, Targeted Raids, Robbery/Theft)

Keep a separate running list for:
* **Targeted Populations** (Are specific types of people targeted/surveilled due to their identity/race/background?)
* **Targeted Activities** (Are specific activities abnormally targeted - e.g. protests, calls for government transparency, etc.?)
* **Sensitive Events** (Are there specific historic/anniversary/holiday dates, upcoming elections (https://www.ndi.org/elections-calendar), or other known events to be noted?)
* **Sources and New Additions** (What resources have you found, ?)

If the country(ies) of interest are in the [Freedom on the Net](https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-net) report, you will be able to gather a great deal of baseline information across all the sections by reading through the relevant country reports. The key internet controls found in the Freedom on the Net report ( [https://freedomhouse.org/report/key-internet-controls-table-2016](https://freedomhouse.org/report/key-internet-controls-table-2016) ) guided many of the categories used here, reducing the effort required to create a baseline report. More advanced reporting could include references to the [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/) (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) taxonomy, and auditors may also be interested in leveraging the [STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) standard to better automate sharing and further research into specific threats using threat information sharing platforms.

Additional organizations which regularly release in-depth digital security focused country reports which are strongly recommended to review in creation of an assessment are listed below. These sources often link to their primary sources or other groups doing dedicated research on the country or topic for further research.  In addition, sub-sections list topic-specific research ideas.
