After completing an automated vulnerability scan (network, system, webapp) and documenting findings, you can now move into vulnerability research:

  * Reviewing your findings by researching on public vulnerability Databases about the vulnerability that you have found.
  * Identify and enumerate risks involved for a certain vulnerability
  * Formulate a mitigation plan or recommendations
 Below is a list of some of the most common vulnerability databases:
    - [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov)
    - [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com)
    - [Rapid 7 Vulnerability & Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db)
    - [SecurityFocus BugTraq Database](https://www.securityfocus.com/bid)  
    - [WPScan Vulnerability Database](https://wpvulndb.com)
    - [PacketStorm](https://packetstormsecurity.com)
    - [CVEDetails](https://www.cvedetails.com)
    - [KB CERT](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls)
    - [Skybox Security](https://www.vulnerabilitycenter.com/#search)

 Validation:
 Each of your findings, once reviewed and documented will be enough for your report. However, if you and the organization agreed to verify findings and vulnerability truly exist, you may refer to Penetration Testing resources within SAFETAG framework.
