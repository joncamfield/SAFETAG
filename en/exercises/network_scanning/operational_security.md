* **In Scope Devices** Just always remember that some may not want you to scan everything on their network. To avoid this, always ask your auditee if there are specific devices that needs exclusion. These machine can be critical to their operation or they just don't want to get scanned. If your auditee have exclusions, explain the consequences possible if a machine does not undergo vulnerability assessment. If scanning public servers, verify that the server host (web company, cloud provider, etc.) has approved of the scan, and than remote scanning is legal in the jurisdiction you are performing it from and in the location of the remote server.
