* Confirm what devices and servers are in scope of the audit, and confirm that any service providers (website hosts, cloud hosts, etc.) are informed and OK with any scanning to be conducted.
* Enumerate and categorize all devices connected to the organization's network.
* Categorize and gather additional detail on the devices that you will discover
* Explore potential vulnerabilities, unexpected devices, and suspicious open ports
* In some cases, the audit scope may include external devices. The scanning in these cases will be very targeted. If your auditee agreed to have their public facing machines scanned, keep in mind that you need to consider asking your auditee for whitelisting options for shunning IDS/IPS, firewalls and other blocking mechanisms during your scan. Also make sure that you have verified the target in-scope. This is to avoid scanning out-of-scope targets that may lead you to other problems..
