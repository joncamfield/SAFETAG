Network scanning is a technique used to gather information about devices connected on a certain network. It involves enumerating open ports and services running to determine the type of device, the operating system it is running, the applications that is it running and a lot more. There are a lot of open source tools that you can used to perform this technique. Though it may look like simple and ordinary technique, it may be used for both good and bad intentions.

The goal for this exercise is to identify, enumerate and categorize all devices connected to the network. Any device that has an IP address is our target. This may include:

  - Desktop computers
  - Laptop computers
  - Tablet devices
  - Mobile phones
  - Printers
  - Wireless routers
  - VoIP devices
  - Smart TVs and appliances
  - Servers and storage devices
