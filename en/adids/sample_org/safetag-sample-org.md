## Sample Organization ##

This provides a detailed snapshot of an organization that can be used as a focal point during SAFETAG training for examples, program concepts, personalities, and office setup. Trainers can adopt personalities from this for mock interviews and to answer questions from the  risk assessment or critical data exercises.

### Organization: Local Media Rights (LMR)
(http://LocalMediaRights.org)

**Mission**: "Advancing the next generation of local and independent media"

**Slogan**: "Media is a Right"

LMR works with local journalists and activists supporting freedom of expression and human rights through multiple programs, including training, incubation, and outreach.

#### Programs and Procedures ####

LMR has two active projects, a training program called "Local Media Next" managed by the Program Manager, and an incubation program supporting a collaborative blog called "MediaRights". Outreach and advocacy work is an ongoing task, but not always "funded".

##### Project: Local Media Next #####
LMNext provides a series of training events in different tracks on advocacy, journalism, HR documentation. It has added an online component to some of the trainings as well.

Components:

 * Outreach to trainees via email, partners, journalist networks, schools
 * Training events
 * MOOC?
 * email lists?

##### Project: MediaRights #####

MediaRights is a policy/political blog on the current laws and implications on human rights in the country. It has drawn criticism from the government and was DDoSed once after a particularly harsh post. The bloggers share one account but often will sign their names to posts they write. They tend to be medium high profile (a university professor, the Executive Director and Project Director of LMR, etc.), but it also includes some university students and independent activists.

As part of the incubation, the external writers are provided with small stipends for their posts, LMR paid for the site set-up and hosting, and has the Program Assistant do copy-editing, formatting and also posts the stories on the blog in most cases.

Components:

 * Self-Hosted Wordpress blog w/shared admin login (no SSL)
 * Emailed drafts
 * Google doc drafts


#### People ####
**Executive Director, Jamie** : Jamie is very excited about improving the organization's digital security.  Jamie met some trainers at a conference and believes it is important for the organization.  Jamie reached out to the auditor and has been the primary point of contact and the "managerial interview" subject.  Unfortunately, the audit overlaps with an important presentation, and Jamie will not available or even particularly responsive to email. More of a visionary than a leader, Jamie is often absent or disconnected from the details and challenges of the office. Jamis is fluent in a variety of languages.

**Office Manager (and tech lead, printer repair, etc.), Taylor** : Taylor is stretched between managing the finances for the entire organization, much of the grant-writing nitty-gritty and reporting work, and on top of that is the most technical person in the office;  often found supporting staff (mostly the ED) in printing/adware/website issues. Taylor speaks limited English in addition to the local language.

**Project Director, Cameron** : Cameron has the most seniority at the office, and both is the primary "director" or leader of the office as well as the lead on most of their program work. Cameron's time is heavily impacted by funding and reporting cycles, and often is the one to respond to emergencies.  While amazingly dedicated to the mission and work -- especially the core human rights programs -- Cameron has dealt with some difficult crises both in life and working at LMR. Cameron is somewhat resistant to change, especially change that complicates "getting things done."

**Communications Director / Outreach Program Manager, Dylan** : Dylan recently joined the organization to manage the website and other outreach/PR activities as the communications director, but helped win a large grant to work on digital media and now also directs this new program.  Dylan is ... not resistant enough to change, and signs up for every new app or social media site, and always has the latest, shiniest tech, but is not actually very deeply skilled technically speaking, but more of a "digital native" who is comfortable using, but not fiddling with, tech.

**Program Manager, Shane**: Shane does a lot of the heavy lifting on many of the LMR programs, including working with partners, doing field research, and contributes content to both reports and proposals.  Shane has a more "field" based view of the work.

**Program Assistant, Casey** : Casey handles a lot of the secretarial work of scheduling, supporting the directors, compiling reports and generally keeping things running.  Casey is comfortable with tech, but not a fast adopter -- preferring training and support from the office manager or Carter rather than fixing things that break.

**Office Support, Carter** : Carter is the first to arrive every day to unlock the office, make tea, and fetch lunch.  Comfortable enough in working on printers, and enjoys using cheap but interesting technology.

### Office Network and Devices ###

Exec Dir and Comms Dir both have Mac laptops at OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion). They did not upgrade because they heard Mavericks didn't work well.

Program manager has a Windows laptop running a legitimate version of Windows 7 with an expired commercial AV
Rest of staff uses older desktops running legitimate Windows XP.

The network has a wireless router with default passwords that serves as the firewall and switch for the office. The router is connected to a cablemodem, and both are in an open cabinet.

Cables are run to the desktop machines and the laptops are on wireless.  The Exec director has a cable at their desk, but rarely uses it. There is only one wifi network, named "mediarights" with the password l0calmedia2011. This password can be found on the whiteboard in the main / meeting room of the office.

There is a file server (running Windows 2003) and an Apple Time Machine on the network. Physically, the Time Machine is next to the wireless router, and the server is in a closet in the program staff office.
