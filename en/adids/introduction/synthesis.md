Open discussion	- if there is not much energy or conversation, consider introducing some topics for discussion such as:

  * Organizational Change experiences of the participants - both failures and successes
  * Risks inherent in performing digital security work for at-risk organizations, pros and cons
  * The role of more aggressive penetration testing
  * The role of a SAFETAG audit in the larger digital security ecosystem of awareness raising, trainings, and improvements.
  * Explore any other responsibilities for auditors and organizations not enumerated here. Are these sufficient? What are the gaps?
